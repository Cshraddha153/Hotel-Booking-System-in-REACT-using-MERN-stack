**Hotel Booking Website**
<br>
A full-stack hotel booking platform using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. User authentication is handled via Clerk.dev, 
with user data stored in MongoDB through webhooks. Hotel owners can register hotels, manage bookings, and track revenue through a 
real-time dashboard. Stripe is integrated for secure online payments, and Brevo is used for sending email confirmations. Users can 
search hotels by city, and recent searches are stored. Protected routes use Clerk-verified JWTs. The app is modular, responsive, 
and optimized for seamless user experience.
